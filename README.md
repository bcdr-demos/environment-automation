# environment automation

An express app that uses built-in features from [Coder environments](https://coder.com/docs/environments) and [coder-cli](https://github.com/cdr/coder-cli) to do some cool automated stuff outside of Coder's main Ui.

This is meant to be installed in a Coder environment to utilize the environment variable stuff, but the create/command exec functionality could work on any system with coder-cli installed.
